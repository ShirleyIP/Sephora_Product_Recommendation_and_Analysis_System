# Product Brand and Category Analysis Tool

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for analyzing product brand data and their respective reviews. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Tkinter, the tool allows users to explore product brands, categories, and detailed information about popular products.

## Features

- **Total Unique Brands**: Displays the total number of unique product brands.
- **Most Popular Brands**: Lists the top 10 most popular brands based on the number of 'loves' received, along with a bar chart visualization.
- **Unique Categories**: Shows all unique product categories, including primary, secondary, and tertiary categories.
- **Most Popular Categories**: Displays the top product categories and visualizes them in bar charts.
- **Most Popular Product**: Shows details about the most popular product, including an image.
- **Product with Most Reviews**: Displays the product that has the highest number of reviews, along with average ratings.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
- Pillow (for image handling)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib pillow
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that you have the following CSV files in the same directory as the script:
   - `cleaned_product_info.csv`: Contains cleaned product information.
   - `cleaned_reviews_*.csv`: Contains cleaned review data (multiple files are supported).

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the script in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
   ```

3. **Explore the GUI**: Use the buttons to navigate through the functionalities:
   - Click on any button to display the corresponding information in the text area.
